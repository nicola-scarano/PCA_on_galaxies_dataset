# PCA on galaxies dataset

Abstractâ€”In this homework, we apply to a dataset of galaxy
characteristics the PCA, giving interpretation to the principal
components(PCs) and the other results; moving first steps from
the preparation and the analysis of the dataset, going forward
to a visualization part related to the influence of the features on
the main PCs. Eventually, we solve a regression task to evaluate
the advantages of the Principal Component Analysis.
